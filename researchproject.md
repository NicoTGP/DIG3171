# Abstract





“Human creativity is responsive in the dynamic operation of interrelated technologies that
constitute an interconnected technological world” (Blok). What are video games? They can
be art; they can be a pastime. They can be bite-sized; they can be massive, hour-long
journeys. Video games can be many things for many people, but what do they say about
us? Our values, our cultural differences, our way of telling stories, or crafting games, or
how we have a desire to take what was or is, and remix it and possibly improve it. Not only
that, but how they can impact us emotionally, and how they can resonate and have a long-
lasting impression, even when the game is over. “Because players' choices in games are
tied to consequences that stem from their own actions, games engage players in ethically
and emotionally meaningful reflections of personal agency and responsibility” (Sicart). For
this project, I go through the history of video games, especially in the early decades, to find
the meaning and observations that can be made about the human condition through the
medium of video games. 


Games can evoke deep emotional responses by enabling and
creating scenarios that allow for introspection about what it means to be human. (Isbister)
I used my long knowledge of the gaming industry, history, and medium, as well as the use of Twine,
to figure out the most efficient way to break down what titles and what
aspect of gaming I should focus on. “Games offer a unique emotional engagement by
placing players in situations of failure and struggle—and it is through encountering one’s
own limitations that one gains insight into one’s motivations, attitudes, and identity” (Juul).
From Pong to Wii Sports, from Dig Dug to Minecraft. Evolution gives us the impression that
these games are immensely different and unrelated, but when you break it down, it’s all
based on a vantage point. Only in the world of gaming does a concept like Space Invaders
lead to Galaga, which can lead to Star Fox, which can lead to No Man’s Sky. “With
Improved technology, human creativity flourishes, and becomes abundant. In our
ecological concept of human-technology creation … human creativity is responsive in the
dynamic operation of interrelated technologies that constitute an interconnected
technological world” (Berenbach).
